=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Business::RO::TaxDeduction;

    my $brtd = Business::RO::TaxDeduction->new(
        vbl     => 1400,
        persons => 3,
    );
    my $amount = $brtd->tax_deduction;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Romanian salary tax deduction calculator.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 vbl

The C<vbl> attribute holds the input amount of the tax deduction
calculation.  (ro: Venit Brut Lunar).

=head3 year

The C<year> attribute holds the year of the tax deduction calculation.

=head3 persons

The C<persons> attribute holds the number of persons.  Not required,
the default is 0.

=head3 deduction

The C<deduction> attribute holds a
C<Business::RO::TaxDeduction::Amount> object instance.

=head3 ten

A Math::BigFloat object instance for 10.

=head3 five

A Math::BigFloat object instance for 5.

=head2 INSTANCE METHODS

=head3 tax_deduction

Return the deduction calculated for the given amount.

Starting with the current version (0.004) the appropriate algorithm
for the tax deduction calculation year is chosen.

=head3 _tax_deduction_formula

Formula for calculating the tax deduction for amounts above C<vbl_min>
and less or equal to C<vbl_max>.

=head3 _round_to_int

Custom rounding method to the nearest integer.  It uses the Romanian
standard for rounding in bookkeeping.

Example:

  10.01 -:- 10.49 => 10
  10.50 -:- 10.99 => 11

=head3 _round_to_tens

Round up to tens.  Uses Math::BigFloat to prevent rounding errors like
when amount minus floor(amount) gives something like 7.105427357601e-15.
